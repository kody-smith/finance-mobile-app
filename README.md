# Flutter Mobile App

This is a mobile app developed using Flutter and Dart. The app is designed to be a finance tracking app that will help you stay up to date on your income and expense and have a comprehensive view of your total balance. 

Here is a link to a video in which I demo the app and explain more in depth how it works.
